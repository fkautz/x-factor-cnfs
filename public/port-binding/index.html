<h2 id="vii-port-binding">VII. Port binding</h2>

<p>Port binding has been removed from X-factor CNFs. Exposing services over the orchestration-managed network interface is not recommended.</p>

<p>However, if an X-factor CNF must provide a service over the orchestration-managed network interface, the X-factor CNF follows the same rules as a 12-factor app, as follows:</p>

<h3 id="12-factor-rule-vii-port-binding">12-factor rule VII. Port binding</h3>

<h4 id="export-services-via-port-binding">Export services via port binding</h4>

<p>Web apps are sometimes executed inside a webserver container.  For example, PHP apps might run as a module inside <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPD</a>, or Java apps might run inside <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained</strong> and does not rely on runtime injection of a webserver into the execution environment to create a web-facing service.  The web app <strong>exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port</strong>, and listening to requests coming in on that port.</p>

<p>In a local development environment, the developer visits a service URL like <code>http://localhost:5000/</code> to access the service exported by their app.  In deployment, a routing layer handles routing requests from a public-facing hostname to the port-bound web processes.</p>

<p>This is typically implemented by using <a href="./dependencies">dependency declaration</a> to add a webserver library to the app, such as <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> for Python, <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> for Ruby, or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> for Java and other JVM-based languages.  This happens entirely in <em>user space</em>, that is, within the app&rsquo;s code.  The contract with the execution environment is binding to a port to serve requests.</p>

<p>HTTP is not the only service that can be exported by port binding.  Nearly any kind of server software can be run via a process binding to a port and awaiting incoming requests.  Examples include <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a> (speaking <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>), and <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> (speaking the <a href="http://redis.io/topics/protocol">Redis protocol</a>).</p>

<p>Note also that the port-binding approach means that one app can become the <a href="./backing-services">backing service</a> for another app, by providing the URL to the backing app as a resource handle in the <a href="./config">config</a> for the consuming app.</p>
