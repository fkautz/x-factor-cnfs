<h2 id="vi-processes">VI. Processes</h2>

<h3 id="execute-the-app-as-one-or-more-stateless-processes">Execute the app as one or more stateless processes</h3>

<p>The CNF is executed in the execution environment as one or more <em>processes</em>.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, the code is a stand-alone script, the execution environment is a developer&rsquo;s local laptop with an installed language runtime, and the process is launched via the command line (for example, <code>python my_script.py</code>).  On the other end of the spectrum, a production deploy of a sophisticated CNF may use many <a href="./concurrency">process types, instantiated into zero or more running processes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>X-factor processes are stateless and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture">share-nothing</a>.</strong>  Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful <a href="./backing-services">backing service</a>, typically a database.</p>

<p>The memory space or filesystem of the process can be used as a brief, single-transaction cache.  For example, downloading a large file, operating on it, and storing the results of the operation in the database.  The X-factor CNF never assumes that anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request or job &ndash; with many processes of each type running, chances are high that a future request will be served by a different process.  Even when running only one process, a restart (triggered by code deploy, config change, or the execution environment relocating the process to a different physical location) will usually wipe out all local (e.g., memory and filesystem) state.</p>

<p>Asset packagers like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-assetpackager/">django-assetpackager</a> use the filesystem as a cache for compiled assets.  A X-factor CNF prefers to do this compiling during the <a href="/build-release-run">build stage</a>. Asset packagers such as <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">Jammit</a> and the <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/guides/asset_pipeline.html">Rails asset pipeline</a> can be configured to package assets during the build stage.</p>

<p>Some web systems rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_%28computing%29#Persistence">&ldquo;sticky sessions&rdquo;</a> &ndash; that is, caching user session data in memory of the app&rsquo;s process and expecting future requests from the same visitor to be routed to the same process.  Sticky sessions are a violation of X-factor and should never be used or relied upon.  Session state data is a good candidate for a datastore that offers time-expiration, such as <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> or <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>.</p>

<h1 id="todo">TODO</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>While web apps may not rely on sticky sessions, it is likely that sticky wirings will exist. We must provide guidance on what to do when such a connection fails. My current recommendation is to provide metadata about how sticky the wirings should be. E.g. should a failure:</p></li>

<li><p>Transparently reconnect to another CNF of the same type (stateless CNFs);</p></li>

<li><p>Notify the CNF of a failure so that it can deal with the failure (stateful CNFs);</p></li>

<li><p>Shutdown the entire chain (fragile stateful chains);</p></li>

<li><p>Or shutdown and reinstantiate multiple parts of the chain</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these can be solved by the CNF. Instead, constraints may be added to the CNF&rsquo;s metadata to provide hints to the orchestrator about how to handle failures and pass context about the failure up and down the chain.</p>
